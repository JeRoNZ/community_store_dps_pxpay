# Community Store Windcave / DPS PXPay2
Windcave / DPS Payment Express PXPay2 payments for Community Store for Concrete CMS

https://github.com/concretecms-community-store/community_store

Install Community Store First.

You will need to obtain a user name and key from Windcave / Payment Express

https://www.windcave.com/

A test account can also be used, which again will need to be issued by Windcave

Test accounts use exactly the same URLs as live accounts - there are no sanbdox URLs as is
the case with PayPal.

This plugin also supports Windcave's Acoount2Account payment method, if it's been enabled on your account.

It appears as a second payment method in the dashboard, and thus as a choice for the user at checkout.

Note that it is necessary to configure the Credit Card account details since these are used by Account2Account also.
